# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI/UX consistency issues across the Nexus healthcare CRM platform. Currently, there are inconsistencies in typography, text selection/highlight behaviors, and color usage between light and dark modes. These inconsistencies create a fragmented user experience and reduce the professional appearance of the application.

The goal is to establish and enforce a unified design system that ensures:
- Consistent typography (fonts, sizes, weights) across all pages and components
- Standardized text selection and highlight behaviors in both light and dark modes
- Uniform color application across the entire application
- Accessible and predictable user interactions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Typography Standardization

**User Story:** As a user navigating the Nexus platform, I want all text to use consistent fonts, sizes, and weights across every page, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page in the application THEN all body text SHALL use the Manrope font family as defined in the layout configuration
2. WHEN a user views headings (h1-h6) THEN they SHALL follow the typography scale defined in globals.css CSS variables (--text-xs through --text-6xl)
3. WHEN a user views buttons, labels, and form inputs THEN they SHALL use consistent font sizes and weights as defined in the base layer typography rules
4. IF a component uses custom typography THEN it SHALL reference the CSS custom properties (--font-sans, --text-base, --font-medium, etc.) rather than hardcoded values
5. WHEN a user switches between pages THEN there SHALL be no visible font family changes or typography inconsistencies

### Requirement 2: Text Selection and Highlight Behavior Standardization

**User Story:** As a user selecting text on the platform, I want text selection highlights to be consistent and readable in both light and dark modes, so that I can easily see what I've selected without accessibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text in light mode THEN the selection background SHALL use a consistent color that maintains readable contrast with the text
2. WHEN a user selects text in dark mode THEN the selection background SHALL use a consistent color that maintains readable contrast with the text
3. WHEN a user tabs through interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) THEN the focus highlight SHALL use consistent colors and styles across all components
4. IF text has a gradient or special styling THEN the selection highlight SHALL override the gradient to ensure readability
5. WHEN a user highlights text in the header navigation THEN it SHALL use the same selection styling as the rest of the application
6. WHEN a user highlights feature text or any interactive element THEN the background color SHALL NOT make the text white in light mode unless explicitly designed for that purpose

### Requirement 3: Light and Dark Mode Color Consistency

**User Story:** As a user switching between light and dark modes, I want all UI elements to use the same color system and maintain consistent visual hierarchy, so that the experience is predictable regardless of theme preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the application in light mode THEN all components SHALL reference CSS custom properties (--background, --foreground, --primary, etc.) from the :root definition
2. WHEN a user views the application in dark mode THEN all components SHALL reference the same CSS custom properties which automatically resolve to .dark class values
3. WHEN a user switches between light and dark modes THEN the color relationships (contrast ratios, hierarchy) SHALL remain consistent
4. IF a component uses hardcoded colors (e.g., #ffffff, rgb(), specific hex values) THEN it SHALL be refactored to use CSS custom properties or Tailwind theme colors
5. WHEN a user views semantic colors (success, warning, error, info) THEN they SHALL maintain consistent meaning and contrast in both light and dark modes
6. WHEN a user views accent colors and gradients THEN they SHALL adapt appropriately to both light and dark modes while maintaining brand consistency

### Requirement 4: Header Highlight Behavior Standardization

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the header navigation, I want consistent and predictable highlight behaviors on all interactive elements, so that I understand what is clickable and what state elements are in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over header navigation items THEN they SHALL display a consistent hover state using theme colors
2. WHEN a user clicks or focuses on header navigation items THEN they SHALL display a consistent active/focus state
3. IF the header uses text selection highlights THEN they SHALL follow the same selection styling rules as the rest of the application
4. WHEN a user views the header in light mode THEN highlight colors SHALL maintain sufficient contrast with the background
5. WHEN a user views the header in dark mode THEN highlight colors SHALL maintain sufficient contrast with the background
6. IF highlight behaviors are not needed for certain header elements THEN they SHALL be explicitly disabled with user-select: none and appropriate CSS

### Requirement 5: Global CSS Custom Property Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Nexus platform, I want all components to use the centralized CSS custom properties, so that design changes can be made consistently across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new component THEN it SHALL use CSS custom properties or Tailwind theme utilities for all colors
2. WHEN a developer creates a new component THEN it SHALL use CSS custom properties for typography (font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height)
3. WHEN a developer creates a new component THEN it SHALL use CSS custom properties for spacing, borders, and shadows
4. IF a component requires theme-specific styling THEN it SHALL use Tailwind's dark: modifier or check for the .dark class
5. WHEN the design system is updated THEN changes to CSS custom properties SHALL automatically propagate to all components
6. WHEN a code review is conducted THEN any hardcoded color, font, or spacing values SHALL be flagged for refactoring

### Requirement 6: Accessibility Compliance for Selection and Focus States

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments or using assistive technologies, I want all selection and focus states to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, so that I can navigate and interact with the platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text THEN the selection SHALL maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and selection background
2. WHEN a user tabs through interactive elements THEN focus indicators SHALL be visible with a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background
3. WHEN a user views focus states THEN they SHALL be clearly distinguishable from hover states
4. IF an element receives keyboard focus THEN it SHALL display a visible focus indicator that is not removed by CSS
5. WHEN a user uses high contrast mode THEN all selection and focus states SHALL remain visible and functional
6. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the focus order SHALL be logical and the focus indicator SHALL be consistently styled
