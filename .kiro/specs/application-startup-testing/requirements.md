# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the requirements for starting and testing the Vival√© Healthcare CRM application. The application is a Next.js-based healthcare management system that needs to be properly configured, started, and tested to ensure all components are working correctly before deployment or development work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start the healthcare CRM application locally, so that I can develop, test, and verify functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs the startup command THEN the Next.js application SHALL start successfully on the default development port
2. WHEN the application starts THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly loaded and validated
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all required services (database, authentication, etc.) SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the console SHALL display clear startup messages indicating successful initialization
5. IF any required configuration is missing THEN the application SHALL display helpful error messages with guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a functional web interface, so that I can interact with and test the healthcare CRM features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN a web browser SHALL be able to access the application at the local development URL
2. WHEN the homepage loads THEN all essential UI components SHALL render correctly
3. WHEN the homepage loads THEN navigation elements SHALL be functional and accessible
4. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the application SHALL display appropriate healthcare-specific branding and layout
5. WHEN the application loads THEN responsive design SHALL work correctly across different screen sizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify core application functionality, so that I can ensure the system is working properly before making changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication THEN the login/signup flows SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN testing navigation THEN all main application routes SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN testing data operations THEN CRUD operations SHALL function properly with the configured database
4. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN all health check endpoints SHALL return successful responses
5. WHEN testing security features THEN authentication and authorization SHALL work as expected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated health checks and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify any issues with the running application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN health check endpoints SHALL be available and responsive
2. WHEN health checks run THEN database connectivity SHALL be verified and reported
3. WHEN health checks run THEN external service dependencies SHALL be tested and their status reported
4. WHEN health checks run THEN application performance metrics SHALL be collected and displayed
5. IF any health check fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper development tooling integration, so that I can efficiently develop and debug the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN hot reloading SHALL work for code changes
2. WHEN the application runs THEN development tools (React DevTools, etc.) SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN the application runs THEN source maps SHALL be available for debugging
4. WHEN the application runs THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL happen automatically
5. WHEN the application runs THEN linting and formatting tools SHALL be integrated and functional
